# Overview

Invowk is a dynamically extensible command runner (similar to `just`, `task`, and `mise`) written in Go 1.25+. It supports multiple execution runtimes: native shell, virtual shell (mvdan/sh), and containerized execution (Docker/Podman). From the user perspective, Invowk offers two key extensibility primitives:
- User-defined commands (called `cmds`), which are defined in `invkfile.cue` files using CUE format. `cmds` are made available under the reserved `invowk cmd` built-in command/namespace.
- User-defined modules, which are filesystem directories named as `<module-id>.invkmod` (preferably using the RDNS convention) that contain:
  - an `invkmod.cue` file
  - an `invkfile.cue` file

  Modules can require other modules as dependencies, which is how Invowk effectively provides modularity and `cmd` re-use for users. Additionally, modules also serve as a means to bundle scripts and ad-hoc files required for `cmd` execution.

  The only guarantee Invowk provides about cross `cmd`/module visibility is that `cmds` from a given module (e.g: `module foo`) that requires another module (e.g.: `module bar`) will be able to see/call `cmds` from the required module -- or, in other words, even though transitive dependencies are supported, only first-level dependencies are effectively exposed to the caller (e.g.: `cmds` from `module foo` will be able to see/call `cmds` from `module bar`, but not from the dependencies of `module bar`).

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user or important learnings: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections
7. **Convert Lessons Into Permanent Rules**: Review and find the best place inside `.claude/rules/` to place the updated lessons from `tasks/lessons.md` if they aren't there already, write them out, then delete `tasks/lessons.md` if the user agrees

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## Rules for Agents (Critical)

**CRITICAL:** Whenever possible and appropriate, multiple Tasks and Subagents must be used.

**CRITICAL:** The files in `.claude/rules/` define the authoritative rules for agents. EVERYTIME there is ANY change to files/rules inside `.claude/rules` (new file, file rename, file removed, etc.), the index/sync map in this file MUST be updated accordingly.

**Index / Sync Map (must match `.claude/rules/`):**
- [`.claude/rules/checklist.md`](.claude/rules/checklist.md) - Pre-completion verification steps.
- [`.claude/rules/commands.md`](.claude/rules/commands.md) - Build, test, and release commands.
- [`.claude/rules/general-rules.md`](.claude/rules/general-rules.md) - Instruction priority, code quality, documentation.
- [`.claude/rules/git.md`](.claude/rules/git.md) - Commit signing, squash merge, message format.
- [`.claude/rules/go-patterns.md`](.claude/rules/go-patterns.md) - Go style, naming, errors, interfaces.
- [`.claude/rules/licensing.md`](.claude/rules/licensing.md) - SPDX headers and MPL-2.0 rules.
- [`.claude/rules/package-design.md`](.claude/rules/package-design.md) - Package boundaries and module design.
- [`.claude/rules/windows.md`](.claude/rules/windows.md) - Windows-specific constraints and guidance.

## Architecture Overview

```
invkfile.cue -> CUE Parser -> pkg/invkfile -> Runtime Selection -> Execution
                                                  |
                                  +---------------+---------------+
                                  |               |               |
                               Native         Virtual        Container
                            (host shell)    (mvdan/sh)    (Docker/Podman)
```

- **CUE Schemas**:
  - `pkg/invkfile/invkfile_schema.cue` defines `invkfile` structure
  - `pkg/invkmod/invkmod_schema.cue` defines `invkmod` structure
  - `internal/config/config_schema.cue` defines config structure
- **Runtime Interface**: All runtimes implement the same interface in `internal/runtime/`.
- **TUI Components**: Built with Charm libraries (bubbletea, huh, lipgloss).

## Directory Layout

- `cmd/invowk/` - CLI commands using Cobra.
- `internal/` - Private packages:
  - `config/` - Configuration management with CUE schema.
  - `container/` - Docker/Podman container engine abstraction.
  - `core/serverbase/` - Shared server state machine base type (used by sshserver, tuiserver).
  - `cueutil/` - Shared CUE parsing utilities (3-step parse pattern, error formatting).
  - `discovery/` - Module and command discovery.
  - `issue/` - Error handling with ActionableError type.
  - `runtime/` - Execution runtimes (native, virtual, container).
  - `sshserver/` - SSH server for remote execution.
  - `tui/` - Terminal UI components.
  - `tuiserver/` - TUI server for interactive sessions.
- `pkg/` - Public packages (invkmod, invkfile).
- `modules/` - Sample invowk modules for validation and reference.

## Container Runtime Limitations

**The container runtime ONLY supports Linux containers.** This is a fundamental design limitation:

- **Supported images**: Debian-based images (e.g., `debian:stable-slim`).
- **NOT supported**: Alpine-based images (`alpine:*`) and Windows container images.

**Why no Alpine support:**
- There are many subtle gotchas in musl-based environments.
- We prioritize reliability over image size.

**Why no Windows container support:**
- They're rarely used and would introduce too much extra complexity to Invowk's auto-provisioning logic (which attaches an ephemeral image layer containing the `invowk` binary and the needed `invkfiles` and `invkmods` to the user-specified image/containerfile when the container runtime is used)

**When writing tests, documentation, or examples:**
- Always use `debian:stable-slim` as the reference container image.
- Never use Alpine images.
- Never use Windows container images (e.g., `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/*`).
