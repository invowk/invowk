Ultrathink. 

CRITICAL: Write a very comprehensive plan/todo for this work. 

$ARGUMENTS. 

CRITICAL: Be EXTREMELY diligent to perform a comprehensive clean up after you finish this work: ensure there are no stale tests, references (in struct/type names, function signatures, code in general, comments, internal CLAUDE docs, README, website docs etc.), or data in general. If in doubt or there is ambiguity, do NOT act immediately; instead, ask me clarifying questions until ALL doubts and ambiguities are solved and ONLY then propose me a detailed follow-up plan.
