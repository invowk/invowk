## Key Guidelines

- In all planning and design decisions, always consider that the code must be highly testable, maintainable, and extensible.
- Always add unit and integration tests to new code.
- Always document the code (functions, structs, etc.) with comments.
- Always use descriptive variable names.
- Always adjust the README and other documentation as needed when making significant changes to the codebase.
- Always refactor unit and integration tests when needed after code changes, considering both the design and semantics of the code changes.
