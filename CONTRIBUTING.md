## 💻 Code Contributions

We're not currently accepting external code contributions. The project is still young and moving fast — we need to establish architectural consistency before opening the door to outside PRs.

That said, if you have a code sample, pattern, or approach you'd like to share, please post it in a [Discussion](https://github.com/invowk/invowk/discussions). The team reviews these regularly, and if something is a great fit, we may reach out to coordinate a one-off contribution.
