# Test: Project invkfile.cue dogfooding smoke test
# Validates that the project's invkfile.cue is parseable and core commands execute.
# This test references the actual project invkfile.cue, so it may need platform
# skips for commands that are legitimately platform-specific.

cd $PROJECT_ROOT

# Core commands (all platforms)
exec invowk cmd hello
stdout 'Hello from invowk!'

exec invowk cmd 'virtual hello'
stdout 'Hello from the virtual shell!'

# List all commands (validates parsing)
exec invowk cmd
stdout 'hello'
stdout 'virtual hello'
