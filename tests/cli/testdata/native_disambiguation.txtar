# Test: Command disambiguation using native runtime (User Story 3)
# Mirrors virtual_disambiguation.txtar but with platform-split native implementations
# Tests @source prefix and --ivk-from flag for disambiguating ambiguous commands

# Change to work directory where the test files will be created
cd $WORK

# Test 1: @source prefix disambiguation - run deploy from invowkfile
exec invowk cmd @invowkfile deploy
stdout 'Deploying from invowkfile!'
! stderr .

# Test 2: @source prefix disambiguation - run deploy from foo module
exec invowk cmd @foo deploy
stdout 'Deploying from foo!'
! stderr .

# Test 3: --ivk-from flag disambiguation - run deploy from invowkfile
exec invowk cmd --ivk-from invowkfile deploy
stdout 'Deploying from invowkfile!'
! stderr .

# Test 4: --ivk-from flag disambiguation - run deploy from foo module
exec invowk cmd --ivk-from foo deploy
stdout 'Deploying from foo!'
! stderr .

# Test 5: Accept full module name with .invowkmod suffix
exec invowk cmd @foo.invowkmod deploy
stdout 'Deploying from foo!'
! stderr .

# Test 6: Accept invowkfile.cue as source name
exec invowk cmd @invowkfile.cue deploy
stdout 'Deploying from invowkfile!'
! stderr .

# Test 7: --ivk-from with full module name
exec invowk cmd --ivk-from foo.invowkmod deploy
stdout 'Deploying from foo!'
! stderr .

# Test 8: Explicit source on non-ambiguous command should work without warning
exec invowk cmd @invowkfile hello
stdout 'Hello from root!'
! stderr .

# Test 9: Explicit source for module-only command
exec invowk cmd @foo build
stdout 'Building from foo!'
! stderr .

# Test 10: Invalid source should show helpful error
! exec invowk cmd @nonexistent deploy
stderr 'Source.*nonexistent.*not found'

# Test 11: Invalid source with --ivk-from should show helpful error
! exec invowk cmd --ivk-from badmodule deploy
stderr 'Source.*badmodule.*not found'

# Test 12: Attempting ambiguous command without disambiguation should fail with suggestions
! exec invowk cmd deploy
stderr 'ambiguous'
stderr '@invowkfile'
stderr '@foo'

# Test 13: Subcommand disambiguation with @source prefix - run "deploy staging" from invowkfile
exec invowk cmd @invowkfile deploy staging
stdout 'Deploying to staging from invowkfile!'
! stderr .

# Test 14: Subcommand disambiguation with @source prefix - run "deploy staging" from bar module
exec invowk cmd @bar deploy staging
stdout 'Deploying to staging from bar!'

# Test 15: Subcommand disambiguation with --ivk-from flag
exec invowk cmd --ivk-from invowkfile deploy staging
stdout 'Deploying to staging from invowkfile!'
! stderr .

# Test 16: Subcommand disambiguation with --ivk-from flag for module
exec invowk cmd --ivk-from bar deploy staging
stdout 'Deploying to staging from bar!'
! stderr .

# Test 17: Attempting ambiguous subcommand without disambiguation should fail
! exec invowk cmd deploy staging
stderr 'ambiguous'
stderr '@invowkfile'
stderr '@bar'

# Test 18: Non-ambiguous subcommand (only in one source) should work without disambiguation
exec invowk cmd deploy production
stdout 'Deploying to production from bar!'
! stderr .

# Test 19: Ambiguity at parent level doesn't affect unambiguous subcommands
# "deploy" is ambiguous but "deploy production" is unique to bar
exec invowk cmd deploy production
stdout 'Deploying to production from bar!'
! stderr .

# Test 20: Different subcommand paths are tracked separately for ambiguity
# "deploy local" exists only in invowkfile, should work without disambiguation
exec invowk cmd deploy local
stdout 'Deploying to local from invowkfile!'
! stderr .
