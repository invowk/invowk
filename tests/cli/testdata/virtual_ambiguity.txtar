# Test: Ambiguous command listing (User Story 3)
# Tests that commands with the same name from different sources show disambiguation annotations
# and cannot be executed without explicit source specification

# Change to work directory where the test files will be created
cd $WORK

# Test 1: List commands - ambiguous commands should show source annotation
# The "deploy" command exists in both invkfile and foo.invkmod
exec invowk cmd
stdout 'From invkfile:'
stdout 'hello'
stdout 'deploy.*@invkfile'
stdout 'From foo.invkmod:'
stdout 'build'
stdout 'deploy.*@foo'
! stderr .

# Test 2: Unambiguous commands should NOT show source annotation
# "hello" only exists in invkfile, "build" only exists in foo
exec invowk cmd
! stdout 'hello.*@'
! stdout 'build.*@'
