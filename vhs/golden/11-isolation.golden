=== Virtual Runtime Isolation Demo ===
Parent values (virtual runtime):
  INVOWK_ARG_DATA = ''
  INVOWK_FLAG_MODE = ''
The isolation mechanism works identically in virtual runtime.
INVOWK_ARG_* and INVOWK_FLAG_* variables are filtered from the
inherited environment before each command execution.
This ensures consistent behavior across native, virtual, and
container runtimes.
