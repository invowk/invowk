Review the Go codebase and look for significant improvement opportunities focused on the type system (increasing type safety in function signatures by avoiding primitive types as much as possible without overengineering, improving abstractions and defensive patterns, increasing code re-use via existing or new abstractions, etc.). Be confident about the value and pros of the changes you propose in a plan.
