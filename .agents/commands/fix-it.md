Carefully analyze all the issues I will point to and propose a robust fix plan to address all of them. Your key guidance is: "How can I not just solve these issues this time but **prevent** them from happening ever again? Are there any deeper code design, test config, or test methodology issues that should be tackled as part of this comprehensive fix?" Ask me for clarification about specific points if you think there are significant trade-offs involved; otherwise, just be concise, assertive, and simplify things as much as possible.
