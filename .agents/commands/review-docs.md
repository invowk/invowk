Review the entire README and website docs (ONLY the 'next' version; do NOT review/change versioned docs) to identify any section, description, and/or explanation that doesn't match the current architecture, feature-set, or behaviors from invowk. Ensure that diagrams should be easy to ready (e.g., flowcharts have the starting block at the top/left side, etc.). Use subagents and teammates coordinated by you. Use the /docs and /d2-diagrams skill.
