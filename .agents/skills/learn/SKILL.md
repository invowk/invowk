description: Learning workflow for when agents finish any architecture changes, refactoring, feature changes, or bug fix work. Use when you finish any other activity to ensure `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, hooks, rules, and skills are up-to-date with your latest learnings and don't have stale data or gaps.

After you finish your work, carefully review `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, memory notes, hooks, `.agents/rules/`, and `.agents/skills/` to double-check they're up-to-date with your latest key learnings and don't have stale data or gaps. Weight the pros and cons of any possible inclusions in relation to **agents**; be mindful of the signal-to-noise ratio in all memory files. If there are duplicates, contradictions, and/or ambiguities, fix them and aim for simplification without losing what really matters.
