# Specification Quality Checklist: Codebase Cleanup Audit

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec identifies 13 functional requirements across 5 categories.
- Three items were explicitly moved to "Out of Scope" (partially implemented features requiring new design).
- The Plan agent discovered additional issues during exploration:
  1. **Legacy validation functions** may exist alongside runtime-aware versions in `cmd.go`
  2. **Inconsistent context cancellation handling** in container runtime vs. SSH server

  These will be addressed during implementation planning if confirmed.
