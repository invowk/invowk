# Invkfile Format

Invkfiles are written in [CUE](https://cuelang.org/), a powerful configuration language that's like JSON with superpowers. If you've never used CUE before, don't worry - it's intuitive and you'll pick it up quickly.

## Why CUE?

We chose CUE over YAML or JSON because:

- **Built-in validation** - CUE catches errors before you run anything
- **No indentation nightmares** - Unlike YAML, a misplaced space won't break everything
- **Comments!** - Yes, you can actually write comments
- **Type safety** - Invowk™'s schema ensures your invkfile is correct
- **Templating** - Reduce repetition with CUE's powerful templating

## Basic Syntax

CUE looks like JSON, but more readable:

<Snippet id="core-concepts/cue-basic-syntax" />

Key differences from JSON:
- No commas needed after fields (though they're allowed)
- Trailing commas are fine
- Comments with `//`
- Multi-line strings with `"""`

## Schema Overview

Every invkfile follows this structure:

<Snippet id="core-concepts/schema-overview" />

The `?` suffix means a field is optional.

## Namespaces via Packs

Invkfiles define commands **without** a namespace. If you want namespacing, put your commands in a pack and define the pack ID in `invkpack.cue`.

See [Commands and Namespaces](./commands-and-namespaces) for pack naming rules and command prefixes.

## Commands Structure

Each command has this structure:

<Snippet id="core-concepts/command-structure" />

### Implementations

A command can have multiple implementations for different platforms/runtimes:

<Snippet id="core-concepts/multi-platform-impl" />

Invowk automatically picks the right implementation for your platform.

## Scripts

Scripts can be inline or reference external files:

### Inline Scripts

<Snippet id="core-concepts/script-inline" />

### External Script Files

<Snippet id="core-concepts/script-external" />

Recognized extensions: `.sh`, `.bash`, `.ps1`, `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.py`, `.rb`, `.pl`, `.zsh`, `.fish`

## Complete Example

Here's a full-featured invkfile:

<Snippet id="core-concepts/full-example" />

## CUE Tips & Tricks

### Reduce Repetition

Use CUE's templating to avoid repetition:

<Snippet id="core-concepts/cue-template" />

### Validation

Run your invkfile through the CUE validator:

<Snippet id="cli/cue-validate" />

Or just try to list commands - Invowk validates automatically:

<Snippet id="cli/list-commands" />
