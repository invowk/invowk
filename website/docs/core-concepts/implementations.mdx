# Implementations

Every command needs at least one **implementation** - the actual code that runs when you invoke the command. Implementations define *what* runs, *where* it runs (platform), and *how* it runs (runtime).

## Basic Structure

An implementation has three main parts:

<Snippet id="implementations/basic-structure" />

## Scripts

The `script` field contains the commands to execute. It can be inline or reference an external file.

### Inline Scripts

Single-line scripts are simple:

<Snippet id="implementations/inline-single" />

Multi-line scripts use triple quotes:

<Snippet id="implementations/inline-multi" />

### External Script Files

Reference a script file instead of inline code:

<Snippet id="core-concepts/script-external" />

Recognized extensions: `.sh`, `.bash`, `.ps1`, `.bat`, `.cmd`, `.py`, `.rb`, `.pl`, `.zsh`, `.fish`

### When to Use External Scripts

- **Inline**: Quick, simple commands; keeps everything in one file
- **External**: Complex scripts; reusable across commands; easier to edit with syntax highlighting

## Runtime and Platform Constraints

Each implementation specifies where and how it runs using the `runtimes` and `platforms` fields.

### Runtimes

Every implementation must specify at least one runtime:

<Snippet id="implementations/runtimes-list" />

The **first runtime** is the default. Users can override with `--runtime`:

```bash
# Uses default runtime (first in list)
invowk cmd myproject build

# Override to use container runtime
invowk cmd myproject build --runtime container
```

See [Runtime Modes](../runtime-modes/overview) for details on each runtime.

### Platforms

Optionally restrict which operating systems the implementation supports:

<Snippet id="implementations/platforms-list" />

If `platforms` is omitted, the implementation works on all platforms.

Available platforms: `linux`, `macos`, `windows`

## Multiple Implementations

Commands can have multiple implementations for different scenarios:

### Platform-Specific Implementations

<Snippet id="implementations/platform-specific" />

Invowk™ automatically selects the right implementation for the current platform.

### Runtime-Specific Implementations

<Snippet id="implementations/runtime-specific" />

### Combined Platform + Runtime

```cue
{
    name: "build"
    implementations: [
        // Linux/macOS with multiple runtime options
        {
            script: "make build"
            runtimes: [
                {name: "native"},
                {name: "container", image: "ubuntu:22.04"}
            ]
            platforms: [{name: "linux"}, {name: "macos"}]
        },
        // Windows native only
        {
            script: "msbuild /p:Configuration=Release"
            runtimes: [{name: "native"}]
            platforms: [{name: "windows"}]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Platform-Specific Environment

Platforms can define their own environment variables:

<Snippet id="implementations/platform-env" />

## Implementation-Level Settings

Implementations can have their own environment, working directory, and dependencies:

<Snippet id="implementations/impl-level-settings" />

These override command-level settings when this implementation is selected.

## Implementation Selection

When you run a command, Invowk selects an implementation based on:

1. **Current platform** - Filters to implementations supporting your OS
2. **Requested runtime** - If `--runtime` specified, uses that; otherwise uses the default
3. **First match wins** - Uses the first implementation matching both criteria

### Selection Examples

Given this command:

<Snippet id="implementations/selection-example" />

| Platform | Command | Selected |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Linux | `invowk cmd myproject build` | First impl, native runtime |
| Linux | `invowk cmd myproject build --runtime virtual` | First impl, virtual runtime |
| Windows | `invowk cmd myproject build` | Second impl, native runtime |
| Windows | `invowk cmd myproject build --runtime virtual` | Error: no matching impl |

## Command Listing

The `invowk cmd list` output shows available runtimes and platforms:

<Snippet id="implementations/list-output" />

- `[native*, virtual]` - Supports native (default) and virtual runtimes
- `(linux, macos)` - Only available on Linux and macOS

## Using CUE Templates

Reduce repetition with CUE templates:

<Snippet id="implementations/cue-templates" />

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple** - One implementation is often enough
2. **Add platforms as needed** - Don't specify platforms unless you need platform-specific behavior
3. **Default runtime first** - Put the most common runtime first in the list
4. **Use templates** - Reduce repetition with CUE's templating
5. **Keep scripts focused** - One task per command; chain with dependencies
