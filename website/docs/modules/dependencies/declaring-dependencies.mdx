# Declaring Dependencies

Pack dependencies are declared in the `requires` field of `invkpack.cue`. This page covers the syntax and options available.

## Basic Syntax

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/basic-invkpack" />

## Requirement Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `git_url` | Yes | Git repository URL (HTTPS or SSH) |
| `version` | Yes | Semantic version constraint |
| `alias` | No | Custom namespace for commands |
| `path` | No | Subdirectory within the repository |

### git_url

The Git repository URL. Supports both HTTPS and SSH formats. The repository must contain a pack (either a `.invkpack` directory or an `invkpack.cue` at the root).

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/git-url-examples" />

### version

Semantic version constraint. The repository must have Git tags matching the constraint.

#### Version Constraint Formats

| Format | Description | Matches |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `^1.2.3` | Compatible (same major) | `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0` |
| `~1.2.3` | Approximately (same minor) | `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0` |
| `>=1.0.0` | Greater than or equal | `1.0.0`, `1.5.0`, `2.0.0`, ... |
| `>1.0.0` | Greater than | `1.0.1`, `1.5.0`, `2.0.0`, ... |
| `<2.0.0` | Less than | `1.9.9`, `1.0.0`, `0.5.0`, ... |
| `<=2.0.0` | Less than or equal | `2.0.0`, `1.9.9`, `1.0.0`, ... |
| `1.2.3` | Exact version | Only `1.2.3` |

#### Version Tag Formats

Invowk accepts tags with or without the `v` prefix:

- `v1.2.3` and `1.2.3` are both valid
- When resolving, both formats are tried automatically

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/version-example" />

### alias

Override the default namespace for the dependency’s commands:

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/alias-example" />

Usage with alias:

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/alias-usage" />

### path

For monorepos containing multiple packs, specify the subdirectory:

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/path-example" />

Paths must be relative and cannot contain `..` or absolute paths.

## Multiple Dependencies

Declare multiple dependencies in the `requires` array:

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/multiple-requires" />

## Authentication

### SSH Keys

For SSH URLs (`git@...`), invowk uses keys from `~/.ssh/`:

1. `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (preferred)
2. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
3. `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`

### HTTPS Tokens

For private HTTPS repositories, set environment variables:

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/auth-tokens" />

## Transitive Dependencies

Dependencies can declare their own dependencies. When you sync, invowk resolves the full dependency tree and records it in the lock file:

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/transitive-tree" />

### Circular Dependency Detection

Invowk detects and reports circular dependencies:

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/circular-error" />

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Caret for Most Dependencies

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/best-practices-version" />

### 2. Use Aliases for Cleaner Namespaces

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/best-practices-alias" />

### 3. Commit Your Lock File

The `invkpack.lock.cue` file should be committed to version control for reproducible builds.

### 4. Update Regularly

<Snippet id="packs/dependencies/update-command" />
