# Configuration Overview

Invowk™ uses a CUE-based configuration file to customize its behavior. This is where you set your preferences for container engines, includes, runtime defaults, and more.

## Configuration File Location

The configuration file lives in your OS-specific config directory:

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Linux    | `~/.config/invowk/config.cue` |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/invowk/config.cue` |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\invowk\config.cue` |

Invowk currently reads configuration from the OS-specific path above. If no config exists there, it will also look for a `config.cue` file in the current directory. If neither is present, defaults are used.

## Creating a Configuration File

The easiest way to create a configuration file is to use the `config init` command:

<Snippet id="config/init" />

This creates a default configuration file with sensible defaults. If a config file already exists, it won't be overwritten (safety first!).

## Viewing Your Configuration

There are several ways to inspect your current configuration:

### Show Human-Readable Config

<Snippet id="config/show" />

This displays your configuration in a friendly, readable format.

### Show Raw CUE

<Snippet id="config/dump" />

This outputs the raw CUE configuration, useful for debugging or copying to another machine.

### Find the Config File

<Snippet id="config/path" />

This prints your configuration paths (config directory, config file, and commands directory). Handy when you want to find and edit your config directly.

## Setting Configuration Values

You can modify configuration values from the command line:

<Snippet id="config/set-examples" />

Or just open the config file in your favorite editor:

<Snippet id="config/edit-linux-macos" />

## Example Configuration

Here's what a typical configuration file looks like:

<Snippet id="config/full-example" />
