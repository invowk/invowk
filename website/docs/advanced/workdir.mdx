# Working Directory

Control where your commands execute with the `workdir` setting. This is especially useful for monorepos and projects with complex directory structures.

## Default Behavior

By default, commands from the root invowkfile run in the directory where the invowkfile is located. For modules, commands run in the module's root directory. Relative `workdir` paths are resolved from these locations.

## Setting Working Directory

### Command Level

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-command" />

### Implementation Level

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-implementation" />

### Root Level

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-root" />

### CLI Override

Override the working directory at runtime:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-cli" />

## Path Types

### Relative Paths

Relative to the invowkfile location:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-relative" />

### Absolute Paths

Full system paths:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-absolute" />

### Environment Variables

Expand variables in paths:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-env-vars" />

## Precedence

CLI override (`--ivk-workdir`) overrides implementation, which overrides command, which overrides root:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-precedence" />

## Monorepo Pattern

Perfect for monorepos with multiple packages:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-monorepo" />

## Container Working Directory

For containers, the current directory is mounted to `/workspace`:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-container-default" />

With `workdir`, that subdirectory becomes the container's working directory:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-container-subdir" />

## Cross-Platform Paths

Use forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility:

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-cross-platform" />

Invowk™ automatically converts to native path separators at runtime.

## Real-World Examples

### Frontend/Backend Split

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-frontend-backend" />

### Test Organization

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-tests" />

### Build in Subdirectory

<Snippet id="advanced/workdir-build-subdir" />

## Best Practices

1. **Use relative paths**: More portable across machines
2. **Forward slashes**: Cross-platform compatible
3. **Root level for defaults**: Override where needed
4. **Keep paths short**: Easier to understand

## Next Steps

- [Interpreters](./interpreters) - Use non-shell interpreters
- [Platform-Specific](./platform-specific) - Per-platform implementations
