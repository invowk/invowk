# Platform-Specific Commands

Create commands that behave differently on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Invowk™ automatically selects the right implementation for the current platform.

## Supported Platforms

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `linux` | Linux distributions |
| `macos` | macOS (Darwin) |
| `windows` | Windows |

## Basic Platform Targeting

Restrict an implementation to specific platforms:

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-open-browser" />

## All Platforms (Default)

If `platforms` is omitted, the implementation works on all platforms:

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-all-default" />

## Unix-Only Commands

Target both Linux and macOS:

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-unix-only" />

## Platform-Specific Environment

Set different environment variables per platform:

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-env" />

## Cross-Platform Scripts

Write one script that works everywhere:

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-cross-script" />

## CUE Templates for Platforms

Use CUE templates to reduce repetition:

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-cue-templates" />

## Command Listing

The command list shows supported platforms:

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-list-output" />

## Unsupported Platform Error

Running a command on an unsupported platform shows a clear error:

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-unsupported-error" />

## Real-World Examples

### System Information

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-sysinfo" />

### Package Installation

<Snippet id="advanced/platform-install-deps" />

## Best Practices

1. **Start with cross-platform**: Add platform-specific only when needed
2. **Use environment variables**: Abstract platform differences
3. **Test on all platforms**: CI should cover all supported platforms
4. **Document limitations**: Note which platforms are supported

## Next Steps

- [Interpreters](./interpreters) - Use non-shell interpreters
- [Working Directory](./workdir) - Control execution location
