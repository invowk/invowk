# Quickstart

Let's run your first Invowk™ command in under 2 minutes. Seriously, grab a coffee first if you want - you'll have time to spare.

## Create Your First Invowkfile

Navigate to any project directory and initialize an invowkfile:

<Snippet id="quickstart/init" />

This creates an `invowkfile.cue` with a `hello` command that works across all three runtimes (native, virtual, and container). Let's peek inside:

<Snippet id="quickstart/default-invowkfile" />

The default template gives you a single `hello` command with four implementations: native (Unix and Windows), virtual (cross-platform), and container. Each implementation declares which platforms it supports.

## List Available Commands

See what commands are available:

<Snippet id="cli/list-commands" />

You'll see something like:

<Snippet id="quickstart/list-output" />

The listing shows the command name, description, allowed runtimes (default marked with `*`), and supported platforms.

## Run a Command

Now let's run one:

<Snippet id="quickstart/run-hello" />

Output:

<Snippet id="quickstart/hello-output" />

That's it! You just ran your first Invowk command.

## Pass an Argument

The `hello` command accepts an optional `name` argument (defaulting to "World"). Try passing your name:

<Snippet id="quickstart/info-command" />

Output:

<Snippet id="quickstart/run-info" />

Arguments are exposed as `INVOWK_ARG_<NAME>` environment variables, making them accessible from any runtime.

## Try the Virtual Runtime

One of Invowk's superpowers is the **virtual runtime** - a built-in shell interpreter that works the same on every platform:

<Snippet id="quickstart/virtual-runtime" />

The virtual runtime uses the [mvdan/sh](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) interpreter, giving you consistent POSIX shell behavior across all platforms - no need for separate Unix and Windows implementations.

## What's Next?

You've just scratched the surface! Head to [Your First Invowkfile](./your-first-invowkfile) to learn how to build more powerful commands with:

- Multiple runtime options (native, virtual, container)
- Dependencies that are validated before running
- Command flags and arguments
- Environment variables
- And much more!
