# Quickstart

Let's run your first Invowk™ command in under 2 minutes. Seriously, grab a coffee first if you want - you'll have time to spare.

## Create Your First Invowkfile

Navigate to any project directory and initialize an invowkfile:

<Snippet id="quickstart/init" />

This creates an `invowkfile.cue` with starter commands for a typical project. Let's peek inside:

<Snippet id="quickstart/default-invowkfile" />

The default template gives you three commands out of the box: `build`, `test`, and `clean`. Don't worry about understanding every detail yet - we'll cover that soon!

## List Available Commands

See what commands are available:

<Snippet id="cli/list-commands" />

You'll see something like:

<Snippet id="quickstart/list-output" />

Commands from the current directory are unprefixed. Module commands will include a module prefix when present.

## Run a Command

Now let's run one:

<Snippet id="quickstart/run-build" />

Output:

<Snippet id="quickstart/build-output" />

That's it! You just ran your first Invowk command.

## Let's Make It More Interesting

Edit your `invowkfile.cue` to add a command that does something more visible:

<Snippet id="quickstart/info-command" />

Now run:

<Snippet id="quickstart/run-info" />

You'll see your system information printed out nicely.

## Try the Virtual Runtime

One of Invowk's superpowers is the **virtual runtime** - a built-in shell interpreter that works the same on every platform:

<Snippet id="quickstart/virtual-runtime" />

The virtual runtime uses the [mvdan/sh](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) interpreter, giving you consistent POSIX shell behavior across all platforms.

## What's Next?

You've just scratched the surface! Head to [Your First Invowkfile](./your-first-invowkfile) to learn how to build more powerful commands with:

- Multiple runtime options (native, virtual, container)
- Dependencies that are validated before running
- Command flags and arguments
- Environment variables
- And much more!
