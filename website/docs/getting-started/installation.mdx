# Installation

:::warning Alpha Software
Invowk™ is currently in **alpha stage**. While we strive for stability, expect breaking changes between releases as we stabilize the invowkfile format, module structure, and feature set. We recommend pinning to a specific version for production use and following the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/invowk/invowk/releases) for migration guides.
:::

Welcome to Invowk! Let's get you set up and running commands in no time.

## Requirements

- **Linux, macOS, or Windows** — Invowk works on all three!

For container runtime features, you'll also need:
- **Docker** or **Podman** installed and running

## Installation Methods

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="script" label="Shell Script" default>

The quickest way to install on **Linux** or **macOS**:

<Snippet id="installation/shell-script" />

This downloads the latest release from GitHub, verifies its SHA256 checksum, and installs to `~/.local/bin`.

**Customize the installation:**

<Snippet id="installation/shell-script-custom" />

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `INSTALL_DIR` | `~/.local/bin` | Where to install the binary |
| `INVOWK_VERSION` | latest stable | Install a specific version (e.g., `v1.0.0`) |

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="homebrew" label="Homebrew">

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on **macOS** or **Linux**:

<Snippet id="installation/homebrew" />

To upgrade later:

```bash
brew upgrade invowk
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go Install">

If you have **Go 1.26+** installed:

<Snippet id="installation/go-install" />

The binary is installed to `$GOBIN` (or `$GOPATH/bin`).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="source" label="From Source">

Clone and build from source:

<Snippet id="installation/build-from-source" />

Then install to your `$GOPATH/bin`:

```bash
make install
```

Or move the binary manually:

<Snippet id="installation/move-to-path" />

> **Note:** On x86-64 systems, the default build targets the x86-64-v3 microarchitecture (Haswell+ CPUs from 2013+) for optimal performance. For maximum compatibility with older CPUs, use `make build GOAMD64=v1`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify Installation

Once installed, verify everything works:

<Snippet id="installation/verify" />

You should see the version information. If you get a "command not found" error, make sure the binary is in your PATH.

### Platform Support

| Method | Linux | macOS | Windows |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| Shell script | amd64, arm64 | amd64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon) | — |
| Homebrew | amd64, arm64 | amd64, arm64 | — |
| Go install | all | all | all |
| From source | all | all | all |

## Upgrading

Invowk includes a built-in upgrade command:

```bash
# Check for available updates
invowk upgrade --check

# Upgrade to the latest stable version
invowk upgrade

# Upgrade to a specific version
invowk upgrade v1.2.0

# Skip confirmation prompt
invowk upgrade --yes
```

If you installed via **Homebrew**, use `brew upgrade invowk` instead. If you installed via **`go install`**, use `go install github.com/invowk/invowk@latest`.

## Shell Completion

Invowk supports tab completion for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell. This makes typing commands much faster!

### Bash

<Snippet id="installation/completion-bash" />

### Zsh

<Snippet id="installation/completion-zsh" />

### Fish

<Snippet id="installation/completion-fish" />

### PowerShell

<Snippet id="installation/completion-powershell" />
