# Command Dependencies (`cmds`)

Command dependencies (`depends_on.cmds`) are a **discovery check**: they ensure specific Invowk™ commands are available (discoverable) before your command runs.

Invowk does **not** execute those commands automatically.

## Basic Usage

<Snippet id="dependencies/commands-basic" />

If none of the listed alternatives can be found, Invowk fails with a **Missing Commands** dependency error.

## Naming & Resolution

- **Same invkfile**: you may reference commands without a group prefix (e.g., `"build"`, `"test unit"`). Invowk resolves these against the current invkfile `group`.
- **Other invkfiles / packs**: use the full group-prefixed name (e.g., `"shared generate-types"`).

## Alternatives (OR Semantics)

<Snippet id="dependencies/commands-alternatives" />

The dependency is satisfied if **any** alternative is discoverable.

## Multiple Requirements (AND Semantics)

<Snippet id="dependencies/commands-multiple" />

All entries must be satisfied.

## Cross-Invkfile Requirements

<Snippet id="dependencies/commands-cross-invkfile" />

This is especially useful when your invkfile expects another invkfile/pack to be installed.

## If you want workflows…

If you want `deploy` to actually run `build` first, do it explicitly in your script (or create a dedicated “workflow” command). Invowk doesn’t orchestrate command execution via `depends_on.cmds`.
