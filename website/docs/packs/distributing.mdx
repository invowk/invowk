# Distributing Packs

Share your packs with teammates, across organizations, or with the world.

## Creating Archives

Create a zip archive for distribution:

<Snippet id="packs/archive-basic" />

Output:

<Snippet id="packs/archive-output" />

## Importing Packs

### From Local File

<Snippet id="packs/import-local" />

### From URL

<Snippet id="packs/import-url" />

Output:

<Snippet id="packs/import-output" />

## Listing Installed Packs

<Snippet id="packs/list" />

Output:

<Snippet id="packs/list-output" />

## Distribution Methods

### Direct Sharing

1. Create archive: `invowk pack archive`
2. Share the zip file (email, Slack, etc.)
3. Recipient imports: `invowk pack import`

### Git Repository

Include packs in your repo:

<Snippet id="packs/git-structure" />

Team members get packs when they clone the repo.

### GitHub Releases

1. Create archive
2. Attach to GitHub release
3. Share the download URL

<Snippet id="packs/github-release" />

### Package Registry (Future)

Future versions may support:

<Snippet id="packs/future-install" />

## Install Locations

### User Commands (Default)

<Snippet id="packs/install-user" />

Available globally for the user.

### Project-Local

<Snippet id="packs/install-project" />

Only available in this project.

### Custom Search Path

Configure additional search paths:

<Snippet id="packs/search-paths-config" />

Install there:

<Snippet id="packs/install-search-path" />

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

Use version in your invkfile:

<Snippet id="packs/version-invkfile" />

### Archive Naming

Include version in archive name:

<Snippet id="packs/archive-versioned" />

### Upgrade Process

<Snippet id="packs/upgrade-process" />

## Team Distribution

### Shared Network Location

<Snippet id="packs/team-shared-location" />

### Internal Package Server

Host packs on internal HTTP server:

<Snippet id="packs/internal-server" />

## Best Practices

1. **Validate before archiving**: `invowk pack validate --deep`
2. **Use semantic versioning**: Track changes clearly
3. **Include README**: Document pack usage
4. **RDNS naming**: Prevent conflicts
5. **Changelog**: Document what changed between versions

## Example Workflow

<Snippet id="packs/workflow-example" />
