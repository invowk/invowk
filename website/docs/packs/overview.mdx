# Packs Overview

:::warning Alpha — Pack Format May Change
The pack format and structure are still being finalized. While we aim for backwards compatibility, **breaking changes may occur** before the 1.0 release. If you're distributing packs externally, be prepared to update them when upgrading Invowk.
:::

Packs are self-contained folders that bundle an invkfile together with its script files. They're perfect for sharing commands, creating reusable toolkits, and distributing automation across teams.

## What is a Pack?

A pack is a directory with the `.invkpack` suffix:

<Snippet id="packs/structure-basic" />

## Why Use Packs?

- **Portability**: Share a complete command set as a single folder
- **Self-contained**: Scripts are bundled with the invkfile
- **Cross-platform**: Forward slash paths work everywhere
- **Namespace isolation**: RDNS naming prevents conflicts
- **Easy distribution**: Zip, share, unzip

## Quick Start

### Create a Pack

<Snippet id="packs/quick-create" />

Creates:

<Snippet id="packs/quick-create-output" />

### Use the Pack

Packs are automatically discovered from:
1. Current directory
2. `~/.invowk/cmds/` (user commands)
3. Configured search paths

<Snippet id="packs/quick-use" />

### Share the Pack

<Snippet id="packs/quick-share" />

## Pack Structure

### Required Files

- **`invkfile.cue`**: Command definitions (must be at pack root)

### Optional Contents

- **Scripts**: Shell scripts, Python files, etc.
- **Templates**: Configuration templates
- **Data**: Any supporting files

### Example Structure

<Snippet id="packs/structure-example" />

## Pack Naming

Pack folder names follow these rules:

| Rule | Valid | Invalid |
|------|-------|---------|
| End with `.invkpack` | `mytools.invkpack` | `mytools` |
| Start with letter | `mytools.invkpack` | `123tools.invkpack` |
| Alphanumeric + dots | `com.example.invkpack` | `my-tools.invkpack` |

### RDNS Naming

Recommended for shared packs:

<Snippet id="packs/rdns-naming" />

## Script Paths

Reference scripts relative to pack root with **forward slashes**:

<Snippet id="packs/script-paths" />

**Important:**
- Always use forward slashes (`/`)
- Paths are relative to pack root
- No absolute paths allowed
- Can't escape pack directory (`../` is invalid)

## Pack Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `invowk pack create` | Create a new pack |
| `invowk pack validate` | Validate pack structure |
| `invowk pack list` | List discovered packs |
| `invowk pack archive` | Create zip archive |
| `invowk pack import` | Install from zip/URL |

## Discovery

Packs are discovered from these locations:

1. **Current directory** (highest priority)
2. **User commands** (`~/.invowk/cmds/`)
3. **Search paths** (from config)

Commands appear in `invowk cmd list` with their source:

<Snippet id="packs/discovery-output" />

## Next Steps

- [Creating Packs](./creating-packs) - Scaffold and structure packs
- [Validating](./validating) - Ensure pack integrity
- [Distributing](./distributing) - Share packs with others
