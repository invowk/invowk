# Validating Packs

Validate your packs to ensure they're correctly structured and ready for distribution.

## Basic Validation

<Snippet id="packs/validate-basic" />

Output for a valid pack:

<Snippet id="packs/validate-basic-output" />

## Deep Validation

Add `--deep` to also parse and validate the invkfile:

<Snippet id="packs/validate-deep" />

Output:

<Snippet id="packs/validate-deep-output" />

## What Gets Validated

### Structure Checks

- Pack directory exists
- `invkfile.cue` is present at root
- No nested packs (packs can't contain other packs)

### Naming Checks

- Folder name ends with `.invkpack`
- Name prefix follows rules (starts with letter, alphanumeric + dots)
- No invalid characters (hyphens, underscores)

### Deep Checks (with `--deep`)

- Invkfile parses without errors
- CUE syntax is valid
- Schema constraints are met
- Script paths are valid (relative, within pack)

## Validation Errors

### Missing Invkfile

<Snippet id="packs/error-missing-invkfile" />

### Invalid Name

<Snippet id="packs/error-invalid-name" />

### Nested Pack

<Snippet id="packs/error-nested" />

### Invalid Invkfile (deep)

<Snippet id="packs/error-parse" />

## Batch Validation

Validate multiple packs:

<Snippet id="packs/validate-batch" />

## CI Integration

Add pack validation to your CI pipeline:

<Snippet id="packs/validate-ci" />

## Common Issues

### Wrong Path Separators

<Snippet id="packs/path-separators-good-bad" />

### Escaping Pack Directory

<Snippet id="packs/escape-pack-dir" />

### Absolute Paths

<Snippet id="packs/absolute-paths" />

## Best Practices

1. **Validate before committing**: Catch issues early
2. **Use `--deep`**: Catches invkfile errors
3. **Validate in CI**: Prevent broken packs from shipping
4. **Fix issues immediately**: Don't let validation debt accumulate

## Next Steps

- [Creating Packs](./creating-packs) - Structure your pack
- [Distributing](./distributing) - Share your pack
