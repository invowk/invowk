# Architecture Overview

This section contains C4 model diagrams and supplementary architecture documentation for Invowk. These diagrams help developers understand the system structure, execution flows, and design decisions.

## Diagram Overview

| Diagram | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| [C4 Context (C1)](./c4-context) | C4 Model | System boundaries, users, external systems |
| [C4 Container (C2)](./c4-container) | C4 Model | Internal components and data stores |
| [Command Execution](./execution-flow) | Sequence | Temporal flow from CLI to execution |
| [Runtime Selection](./runtime-selection) | Flowchart | Decision tree for choosing runtime |
| [Discovery Precedence](./discovery) | Flowchart | How commands are found and conflicts resolved |

## Reading Order

For newcomers to the codebase:

1. **Start with [C4 Context](./c4-context)** - Understand what Invowk is and what it interacts with
2. **Then [C4 Container](./c4-container)** - See the major internal components
3. **Read [Command Execution](./execution-flow)** - Follow the main user journey
4. **Reference others as needed** - Runtime selection and discovery when debugging or extending

## Diagram Technology

All diagrams use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax. Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming tool that renders diagrams from text definitions, making them easy to version control and maintain.

### Editing Diagrams

The [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) is useful for testing changes before committing.

## C4 Model Background

The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) provides a hierarchical way to describe software architecture:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| C1 | Context | System as black box with external actors |
| C2 | Container | Major deployable/runnable units |
| C3 | Component | Internal modules within containers |
| C4 | Code | Class/code-level details |

For Invowk (a single CLI binary), C1 and C2 are most valuable. C3 would show internal Go packages, which are better documented in code.

## Keeping Diagrams Updated

When making significant architectural changes:

1. **Check if diagrams need updates** - New components, changed relationships, removed features
2. **Update the relevant diagram(s)** - Keep changes focused
3. **Verify rendering** - Test in Mermaid Live Editor or the website preview
4. **Update tables and text** - Diagrams alone may not capture all context
