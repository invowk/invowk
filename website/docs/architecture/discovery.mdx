# Discovery Precedence Flowchart

This diagram shows how commands are discovered and how conflicts are resolved when the same command name appears in multiple locations.

## Discovery Flow

<Diagram id="architecture/discovery-flow" />

## Conflict Resolution

When the same command name exists in multiple locations:

<Diagram id="architecture/discovery-conflict" />

### Resolution Rules

| Priority | Source | Example Path |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| 1 (highest) | Current directory invowkfile | `./invowkfile.cue` |
| 2 | Local modules | `./mytools.invowkmod/` |
| 3 | Configured includes | `/opt/invowk-modules/tools.invowkmod` |
| 4 (lowest) | User commands directory | `~/.invowk/cmds/mytools.invowkmod/` |

**Key principles**:
- Closer to the working directory = higher priority.
- Configured includes take precedence over the user commands directory because they represent explicit, intentional configuration.
- The user commands directory (`~/.invowk/cmds/`) only discovers `*.invowkmod` directories as immediate children (non-recursive). Loose invowkfiles are not discovered from this location.

## Module Discovery Details

<Diagram id="architecture/discovery-module-structure" />

### Required Module Fields

```cue
// invowkmod.cue
module: "com.example.mymodule"  // RDNS naming convention
version: "1.0.0"                // Semantic version

// Optional
description: "My useful module"
requires: [
    {
        git: "https://github.com/org/repo.git"
        version: "v1.0.0"
    }
]
```

## Dependency Resolution

<Diagram id="architecture/discovery-deps" />

### Transitive Dependency Visibility

| From | Can Access | Cannot Access |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Module A | A's commands, B's commands | C's commands (transitive) |
| Module B | B's commands, C's commands | - |
| Root invowkfile | Own commands, direct deps | Transitive deps |

**Why this restriction?**
- Prevents implicit coupling to transitive dependencies
- Makes dependencies explicit in each module
- Enables dependency upgrades without breaking consumers

## Includes Configuration

Additional invowkfiles and modules are configured in `~/.config/invowk/config.cue`:

```cue
includes: [
    {path: "/opt/company-invowk-modules/tools.invowkmod"},
    {path: "/home/shared/invowk/invowkfile.cue"},
]
```

### Entry Processing Order

## Discovery Caching

<Diagram id="architecture/discovery-cache" />

## Common Discovery Issues

### Problem: Command Not Found

<Diagram id="architecture/discovery-not-found" />

### Problem: Wrong Command Version

<Diagram id="architecture/discovery-wrong-version" />

## Debug Commands

```bash
# List all discovered commands with sources
invowk cmd --ivk-verbose

# Validate module structure
invowk module validate ./mymodule.invowkmod
```
