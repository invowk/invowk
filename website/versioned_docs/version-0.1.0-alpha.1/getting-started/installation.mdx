# Installation

:::warning Alpha Software
Invowk™ is currently in **alpha stage**. While we strive for stability, expect breaking changes between releases as we stabilize the invkfile format, module structure, and feature set. We recommend pinning to a specific version for production use and following the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/invowk/invowk/releases) for migration guides.
:::

Welcome to Invowk! Let's get you set up and running commands in no time.

## Requirements

Before installing Invowk, make sure you have:

- **Go 1.26+** (only if building from source)
- **Linux, macOS, or Windows** - Invowk works on all three!

For container runtime features, you'll also need:
- **Docker** or **Podman** installed and running

## Installation Methods

### From Source (Recommended for now)

If you have Go installed, building from source is straightforward:

<Snippet id="installation/build-from-source" />

Then move the binary to your PATH:

<Snippet id="installation/move-to-path" />

### Using Make (with more options)

The project includes a Makefile with several build options:

<Snippet id="installation/make-options" />

### Verify Installation

Once installed, verify everything works:

<Snippet id="installation/verify" />

You should see the version information. If you get a "command not found" error, make sure the binary is in your PATH.

## Shell Completion

Invowk supports tab completion for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell. This makes typing commands much faster!

### Bash

<Snippet id="installation/completion-bash" />

### Zsh

<Snippet id="installation/completion-zsh" />

### Fish

<Snippet id="installation/completion-fish" />

### PowerShell

<Snippet id="installation/completion-powershell" />
